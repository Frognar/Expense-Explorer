Expense Explorer is a simple expense tracking application designed to run on a home server, allowing users to manage their receipts and track expenses conveniently.

## Note

This project is undergoing a fresh start with a significantly simplified technical approach. Initially, the app was developed with the goal of exploring and learning new technologies, which made the codebase more complex than desired. To focus on core functionality and maintainability, the original code has been archived on a separate branch [`archive\100commitow`](https://github.com/Frognar/Expense-Explorer/tree/archive/100commitow), and the main branch now reflects a streamlined version of Expense Explorer.
Thank you for your understanding and stay tuned for the new, simplified version!
